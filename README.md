### Interactive Earthquake Tracker ###

This project is published at https://billsgithubacct.github.io/earthquake-mapping-hw/

Plays through all earthquake data points recorded for the past week.

The size and color of the circles represent the magnitude of the earthquakes, and the circles appear on the  timeline as they occured.  

Includes several base maps including outdoors and satelite and dark maps.

Pop ups with detail information about each earthquake are available by clicking on the earthquake nodes.
